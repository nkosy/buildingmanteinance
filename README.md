I have noticed from the knowledge I acquired from a company I used to work for and from the building I live in that there are always manteince issues involved. When tenants complain about manteinance issues its either they dont get fixed or there is a major delay in getting it fixed. Sometimes it is not known when last a specific manteinance job was done and who last did it, if problems occur there is no way of tracking the company that did the job. Out of my frustration as a tenat I decided to come up with a program that will solve the problem.

This application manages the manteinance of a building. It keeps track of everything in the building, who mantains it when it is manteined. The application also handles the manteinatnce logs from the tenants solving the problem of having manteinace problems within a building.
